Methods: The cross-sectional study surveyed mothers of children aged 6\textendash 23 months. A total of 3455 mothers were selected via multistage cluster sampling. The seven health outcomes related to the community health worker (CHW) visits were: institutional delivery, complete immunization, exclusive breastfeeding for six months, timely introduction of complementary feeding, continued breastfeeding during child's illness, handwashing, and awareness of Nutrition and Health Days (NHDs). Results: The results varied by state. Mothers who received ASHA visits were significantly less likely to have an institutional delivery, timely introduction of complementary feeding, awareness of Nutrition and Health Days (NHDs), proper handwashing, and exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months in at least one of the four states. Conversely, AWW's home visits were positively predictive of the following health outcomes in certain states: complete immunization for index child, continued breastfeeding during the child's illness, handwashing, and awareness of NHDs. Conclusions: ASHAs' home visits were not more strongly associated with health outcomes for which they were paid than outcomes for which they were unpaid. AWWs' home visits were positively associated with awareness of NHDs, and associations varied for other recommended health behaviors. Further research could elucidate the causes for successes and failures of CHW programs in different states of India.},

The strength of CHWs' relationships with both sides influences their motivation and performance. This qualitative comparative study aimed at understanding similarities and differences in how relationships between CHWs, communities and the health sector were shaped in different Sub-Saharan African settings. The study demonstrates a complex interplay of influences on trust and CHWs' relationships with their communities and actors in the health sector. Mechanisms influencing relationships were feelings of (dis)connectedness, (un)familiarity and serving the same goals, and perceptions of received support, respect, competence, honesty, fairness and recognition. Sometimes, constrained relationships between CHWs and the health sector resulted in weaker relationships between CHWs and communities. The broader context (such as the socio-economic situation) and programme context (related to, for example, task-shifting, volunteering and supervision) in which these mechanisms took place were identified. Policy-makers and programme managers should take into account the broader context and could adjust CHW programmes so that they trigger mechanisms that generate trusting relationships between CHWs, communities and other actors in the health system. This can contribute to enabling CHWs to perform well and responding to the opportunities offered by their unique intermediary position.},

In contrast, hormones that coordinate this homeostasis, including cortisol, respond acutely to stressors. Because maternal cortisol crosses the placenta to influence fetal tissues, transient stress activation during pregnancy can durably change offspring development. These principles lead to the expectation that adversity during pregnancy will primarily impact offspring via acutely-responsive systems like stress physiology, while intergenerational effects of the mother's protein\textendash energy nutrition will reflect her chronic nutritional experiences across pre-pregnant life. Thus, although developing fetal systems are sensitive to maternal psychosocial and nutritional adversity in utero, the intergenerational impacts of these systems reflect distinct timescales of maternal experience.},

However, challenges in program design and sustainability are expanded when such programs are expanded at scale, particularly with regard to systems management and integration with primary health facilities.

Considering their role as a link between community and health systems, frontline workers (FLWs) can be effectively utilized in strengthening maternal and newborn care. In this paper, we set out to examine the effect of intensity of contact with FLWs on key maternal and newborn health behaviors and to determine if this association varies by status of Self Help Group (SHG) membership. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study included 2208 currently married women aged 15\textendash 49 years who had delivered a baby during the last 15 months prior to the survey and selected through a multi-stage cluster sampling from rural villages and urban wards. The outcome of interest included variables related to key knowledge and practice of healthy behavior in relation to maternal and newborn health and exposure variable considered was intensity of contact with FLWs. Results: Of the women interviewed, 1729 (78\%) belonged to SHG household. For knowledge on the need for at least 3 antenatal care (ANC) check-ups, two tetanus toxoid (TT) injections and consumption of 100 or more ironfolic acid (IFA) tablets, proportion of those who were aware of these practices increased with increasing number of contacts with FLWs (P value {$<$} 0.001). Practice for TT injections showed an increasing trend with increasing number of contacts with FLW. An increase in the odds of delivering in an institution was observed in those who had higher number of contacts as compared to those with no contacts (P value {$<$} 0.001). With regard to newborn healthy behavior practice, breastfeeding within 1 h of delivery showed significant association and the odds of this practice improved in those who had {$\geq$} 3 contacts with FLW as compared to those had no contacts. Except for consumption of 100 or more IFA tablets, there was no interaction of these associations by SHG status. Conclusion: There was an overall low prevalence of both knowledge and practice of key maternal and newborn healthy behaviors and only a few of these were associated with frequency of contacts with FLW. Findings not only highlight the urgent need for effectively leveraging FLWs to strengthen maternal and newborn care but also to improve the quality of services provided by them.},

The stressed Anganwadi and ASHA workers are likely to be unhealthy, poorly motivated, less productive, and less efficient in implementing the various national programs. Objective: The objective was to study the level of stress among the grassroot level workers and the various factors related. Materials and Methods: Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. Setting: This was conducted at PHC of Bagalkot district. Study subjects: Grassroot level workers (Anganwadi [n = 46] and ASHA [n = 29] workers) were selected. Sample size: The sample size was 75. Data collection: Date were collected through self-reporting questionnaire schedule consisting of two schedules: (i) Sociodemographic characteristics and (ii) presumptive stressful life events scale questionnaire. Scores used in the study: Fifty-one life events were found to be experienced by the normal Indian population in the past 1 year. For each life event, a mean stress score was given. The total score was obtained for each by adding all the applicable life events scores. Accordingly, they were categorized into no stress, less/moderate stress, and severe stress. Statistical test used: Analysis was performed using Chi-square test. Results: About 61.33\% were Anganwadi and 38.67\% were ASHA workers. 70.67\% had mental stress in the past 1 year. 8\% of the subjects had a family history of mental illness and 25.33\% of them were practicing yoga/meditation. 66.67\% of the study subjects had experienced severe stress and 26.67\% has mild/moderate stress. The factors such as past history of mental illness, socioeconomic status of the participants, house construction, unfulfilled commitments, unemployment of family member, loan, beginning of school, and marital conflict are significantly associated with level of stress. Conclusion and Recommendations: Psychological stress was found to be more among Anganwadi and ASHA workers. They are suggested to practice healthy lifestyles such as yoga and meditation to relieve stress. Key words: Factors associated, grassroot workers, PHC, psychological stress},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dedicated and motivated health workers (HWs) play a major role in delivering efficient and effective health services that improve patients' experience of health care. Growing interest in HW motivation has led to a global focus on pay for performance strategies, but less attention has been paid to nurturing intrinsic motivation. Workplace trust relationships involve fair treatment and respectful interactions between individuals. Such relationships enable cooperation among HWs and their colleagues, supervisors, managers and patients and may act as a source of intrinsic motivation. This paper presents findings from a qualitative systematic review of empirical studies providing evidence on HW motivation, to consider what these studies suggest about the possible influence of workplace trust relationships over motivation. METHODS: Five electronic databases were searched for articles reporting research findings about HW motivation for various cadres published in the 10-year period 2003 to 2013 and with available full free text in the English language. Data extraction involved consideration of the links between trust relationships and motivation, by identifying how studies directly or indirectly mention and discuss relevant factors. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles from low- and middle-income countries and eight from high-income countries that met predetermined quality and inclusion criteria were appraised and subjected to thematic synthesis. Workplace trust relationships with colleagues, supervisors and managers, employing organisation and patients directly and indirectly influence HW motivation. Motivational factors identified as linked to trust include respect; recognition, appreciation and rewards; supervision; teamwork; management support; autonomy; communication, feedback and openness; and staff shortages and resource inadequacy. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first systematic review on trust and motivation in the health sector. Evidence indicates that workplace trust relationships encourage social interactions and cooperation among HWs, have impact on the intrinsic motivation of HWs and have consequences for retention, performance and quality of care. Human resource management and organisational practices are critical in sustaining workplace trust and HW motivation. Research and assessment of the levels of motivation and factors that encourage workplace trust relationships should include how trust and motivation interact and operate for retention, performance and quality of care.},

Considerable progress toward realizing the MDG objectives has been achieved, especially reductions in infant and child mortality and improvement in measles vaccination coverage (MDG Goal 4), as well as the reduction of maternal mortality and an increase in the number of births attended by skilled personnel (MDG Goal 5). Nevertheless, an overall appraisal of the status of the indicators in 2015 reveals that many of the targets remained to be achieved. The analytical issue explored here is whether the targets were too high to achieve or whether Indian health policies were flawed or too long delayed. This article offers a state-wise analysis of the achievements in health indicators relating to MDGs 4 and 5. The rate of achievement for two time periods, pre-NHM and NHM until 2015, is analyzed here. Our key finding is that most of the targets were indeed infeasible, but that lack of achievement could be attributed to delays in planning; sometimes poor execution of the policies and programs; and to the economic, social, and political disparities within the country. Better organized and more innovative approaches at the state level could improve the realization of vital MDG targets, providing improved public health for all.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to provide quantitative evidence on the psychological impact of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks (i.e., SARS, MERS, COVID-19, ebola, and influenza A) on healthcare workers (HCWs). RECENT FINDINGS: Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4\% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3~years in 10-40\%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7\%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1\%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45\%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3\%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1\%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.},

We present an overview of issues and evidence about the determinants of performance and strategies for improving it. Health-worker practices are complex behaviours that have many potential influences. Reviews of intervention studies in low and middle income countries suggest that the simple dissemination of written guidelines is often ineffective, that supervision and audit with feedback is generally effective, and that multifaceted interventions might be more effective than single interventions. Few interventions have been evaluated with rigorous cost-effectiveness trials, and such studies are urgently needed to guide policy. We propose an international collaborative research agenda to generate knowledge about the true determinants of performance and about the effectiveness of strategies to improve performance. Furthermore, we recommend that ministries of health and international organisations should actively help translate research findings into action to improve health-worker performance, and thereby improve health.},

  abstract = {This paper is a critical interpretive synthesis of community health workers (CHWs) and accountability in low-income and middle-income countries. The guiding questions were: What factors promote or undermine CHWs as accountability agents? (and) Can these factors be intentionally fostered or suppressed to impel health system accountability? We conducted an iterative search that included articles addressing the core issue of CHWs and accountability, and articles addressing ancillary issues that emerged in the initial search, such as 'CHWs and equity.'CHWs are intended to comprise a 'bridge' between community members and the formal health system. This bridge function is described in three key ways: service extender, cultural broker, social change agent. We identified several factors that shape the bridging function CHWs play, and thus, their role in fomenting health system accountability to communities, including the local political context, extent and nature of CHW interactions with other community-based structures, health system treatment of CHWs, community perceptions of CHWs, and extent and type of CHW unionisation and collectivisation.Synthesising these findings, we elaborated several analytic propositions relating to the self-reinforcing nature of the factors shaping CHWs' bridging function; the roles of local and national governance; and the human resource and material capacity of the health system. Importantly, community embeddedness, as defined by acceptability, social connections and expertise, is a crucial attribute of CHW ability to foment local government accountability to communities.},

This work reports the results of semi-structured interviews with 15 international stakeholders, selected because of their experiences in CHW program implementation, to elicit their views on strategies that could increase CHW motivation and retention. Data were collected to identify potential interventions that could be tested through a randomized control trial. Suggested interventions were organized into thematic areas; cross-cutting approaches, recruitment, training, supervision, incentives, community involvement and ownership, information and data management, and mHealth. The priority interventions of stakeholders correspond to key areas of the work motivation and CHW literature. Combined, they potentially provide useful insight for programmers engaging in further enquiry into the most locally relevant, acceptable, and evidence-based interventions.},

Further, significant literature illuminated the weakness of SBCC approaches that were primarily topdown and unidirectional and that failed to sufficiently include local actors. In SBCC for public health in areas such as child health and polio vaccination, the evidence is strong that community participatory approaches lead to better behavior outcomes. The literature also strongly supports the effectiveness of approaches that engage communities through interventions that are essentially dialogues; these approaches are more likely to reinforce or restore trust in system actors1 that represent the state. Trust in system actors is critical to achieving behavioral change and lack of trust in these actors thwarts SBCC efforts.},
